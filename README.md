# Location-Web-Application
This is a Spring Boot application to Add, View, Update, Delate Locations.
Here I added Jasper dependency to make use of ***jsp files*** for implement User Interface.

- ## Create Location
This application will allow the end user to create a location in the database. Given Id, code,name of the location and can choose between types whether the location type is **URBAN** or **RURAL** and save.

- ## View Locations
User can view all the locations in the database where we will display all locations by retrieving them. Here I used ***JSTL (Java Standard Tagged Library)*** and ***Expression Language*** to create table **without writing Java code**.

- ## Edit Location
User can edit each of the locations and save that information. Here Id of the location will consider as **Read Only** property.

- ## Delete Location
User can delete an existence location.


> ### This Application allows the end user to perform all CRUD operations on a location from the web browser.
